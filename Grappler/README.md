# Game Complexity

The Grappler game I made is distinct from the other assignments since it uses a Physics based movement system with Physics grappling.
The only overlap is in the use of Probuilder to make my levels.

Complexity wise I believe my game reaches those parameters since I coded the movement system for the player as well as the abilities to jump and crouch
with them all being physics based except for crouching.
I also coded the win/lose triggers and level switching goals at the end of levels.
Implementing both groundCheckers and HeadCheckers also increases the complexity of my game for the mechanics within it.
Finally the last complex implementation is the MouseLook script which deals with rotating the player and the camera differently
